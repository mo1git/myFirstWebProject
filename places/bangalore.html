        year 1878. Chamarajendra Wadiyar's British Guardians bought the original property in 1873 from the principal of
        Bangalore Central High School, Rev, J Garret, from his funds. The palace is extraordinarily vast and spread
        across 45,000 square feet. A mixture of Tudor and Scottish Gothic architecture have resulted into the grand
        palace that we see today. The wooden structure of the palace along with the beautiful carvings both inside and
        outside showcases the royal culture in different ways.</p>
