        alt="image of Howrah bridge loading..." width="700" height="400" />
    <p style="text-indent: 7em;">An iconic landmark of Kolkata, Howrah Bridge is a massive steel bridge constructed over
        the Hooghly River. Howrah Bridge was the third-longest cantilever bridge at the time of its construction, but
        now it is the sixth-longest one of its types. It was renamed as Rabindra Setu on June 14, 1965, after the name
        of Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore. It spreads about 1500 ft over the Hooghly River and is 71 ft wide. There
        is a total of 8 lanes of strand road, bicycles, and pedestrians. What makes this bridge unique is the fact that
        it was built without a single nut or bolt and is held together by rivets.</p>
    <h3>Victoria Memorial</h3>

        alt="image of Victoria Memorial loading..." width="700" height="400" />
    <p style="text-indent: 7em">The Victoria Memorial is located in the heart of Kolkata, in West Bengal. This white
        marbled opulent structure was built in memory of Queen Victoria to celebrate her 25 years of rule over India and
        is almost a replica of the Victoria Memorial in London. The memorial is surrounded by a lush green and
        well-maintained garden, which spreads over 64 acres and has numerous statues and sculptures in it. A
        sixteen-foot tall bronze statue of victory, mounted on ball bearings at the top of the memorial, serves to
        heighten the overall appeal and grandeur of the entire complex. Victoria Memorial is breathtaking and
        marvellous, especially at night, when it is illuminated. The Sound and Light shows that take place in the
        evening are an added delight, and a must watch. All in all, the place is a must visit for people to wish to
        relive the essence of the Victorian era in the modern day world.</p>
